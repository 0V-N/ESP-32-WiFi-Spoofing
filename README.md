# ESP-32-WiFi-Spoofing

--Download the Fake_WIFI.ino file and flash it into an ESP-32 board via Arduino IDE.--

To edit the SSID name, you would modify the string within the quotes after the equal sign. 
For example, if you want to change the SSID name to "MyNewSSID", you would edit the line to:
For adding New name = "MyNewSSID\n"
Make sure to keep the \n at the end of the string as it represents a newline character, which
is commonly used in programming to denote the end of a line.

â€‹" Creating a WiFi spoofing device with an ESP32 involves programming the microcontroller to emulate a legitimate access point, enticing unsuspecting devices to connect to a fake network. Additionally, the ESP32 can be programmed to create a fake API, replicating the behavior of legitimate network services. Once connected, the ESP32 can intercept and manipulate network traffic, potentially compromising sensitive information. However, it's essential to note the ethical and legal implications of such actions. Unauthorized use of WiFi spoofing devices for malicious purposes is illegal and punishable by law. Any use of these devices should be limited to educational or research purposes with explicit consent from network owners and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Always prioritize ethical considerations and respect the privacy and security of others' networks. "
