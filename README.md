--Download the Fake_WIFI.ino file and flash it into an ESP-32 board via Arduino IDE.--

To edit the SSID name, you would modify the string within the quotes after the equal sign. 
For example, if you want to change the SSID name to "MyNewSSID", you would edit the line to:
For adding New name = "MyNewSSID\n"
Make sure to keep the \n at the end of the string as it represents a newline character, which
is commonly used in programming to denote the end of a line.
